Hi there, I'm Gökcan! 👋 <br>
Welcome to my GitHub profile! <br> I'm a Junior Front-End Developer with a strong passion for coding and continuous learning. After transitioning from Mechanical Engineering to Software Development, I'm focused on growing my skills and creating meaningful web applications.

<strong>React & Redux:</strong> I enjoy creating dynamic, user-friendly interfaces using React and manage state effectively with Redux.<br>
<strong>Tailwind CSS:</strong> I believe in fast and efficient styling with Tailwind, making responsive and maintainable designs.<br>
<strong>Bootstrap:</strong> I use Bootstrap for building responsive, mobile-first web applications.<br>
<strong>JavaScript (ES6+):</strong> Crafting interactive, performance-oriented applications with JavaScript.<br>
<strong>React Context API:</strong> I leverage the Context API for state management across large-scale applications.<br>

<strong>💡 What I'm Working On<br></strong>
Currently, I'm working on HeptaIT as a Front-End Developer and building web applications with Next.js,HTML,Bootstrap,Tailwind, CSS and JavaScript.

<strong>🌱 What I'm Learning<br></strong>
I'm constantly refining my skills in front-end development and exploring new technologies that enhance user experiences. Now, i'm working on Next.js,in the near future, I plan to learn TypeScript and Golang.

<strong>📌 Fun Facts<br></strong>
In 2003, I began building my own websites on a platform that allowed users to create ready-made sites. My websites focused on Beyblade and dogs, sparking my early passion for web development and design.
When I'm not coding, you can find me cooking, watching documentaries, practicing martial arts, or organizing trips outside the city.
