Hi there, I'm Gökcan! 👋
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Junior Front-End Developer with a strong passion for coding and continuous learning. After transitioning from Mechanical Engineering to Software Development, I'm focused on growing my skills and creating meaningful web applications.

🛠️ Technologies I Work With
React & Redux: I enjoy creating dynamic, user-friendly interfaces using React and manage state effectively with Redux.
Tailwind CSS: I believe in fast and efficient styling with Tailwind, making responsive and maintainable designs.
Bootstrap: I use Bootstrap for building responsive, mobile-first web applications.
JavaScript (ES6+): Crafting interactive, performance-oriented applications with JavaScript.
React Context API: I leverage the Context API for state management across large-scale applications.
HTML & CSS: Solid understanding of semantic HTML and modern CSS for creating beautiful, accessible web pages.
Photoshop: I create my own visuals and graphics, bringing a design-first approach to my projects.

💡 What I'm Working On
Currently, I'm working on PixelWear, an exciting e-commerce project.

🌱 What I'm Learning
I'm constantly refining my skills in front-end development and exploring new technologies that enhance user experiences. In the near future, I plan to learn TypeScript and Next.js.

📌 Fun Facts
In 2003, I began building my own websites on a platform that allowed users to create ready-made sites. My websites focused on Beyblade and dogs, sparking my early passion for web development and design.
When I'm not coding, you can find me cooking, watching documentaries, practicing martial arts, or organizing trips outside the city.
